Some code to parse Geo for All locations and display a map

# What I did

Python: I used requests to download the data from https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Edu_current_initiatives#Current_members_of_the_Geo_for_All_Labs_Network, BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML tags, and pandas to store and wrangle the data. I exported the completed file to CSV.
